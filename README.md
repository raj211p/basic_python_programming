# basic_python_programming
A collection of Python programs written as a part of an introductory programming exercise.
Program list:

Set 1
1) Calculate the area of a triangle.
2) Convert a given temperature reading in 째C to 째F and 째F to 째C.
3) Find all the digits in a given number.

Set 2
1) Convert a given measure of time in days to a measure of time in years, weeks, and days (leap years aren't accounted for).
2) Find the gravitational force acting on 2 objects.

Set 3
1) Replace each character in a string with the one whose ASCII code is 1 value higher than its own (mimics a substitution cipher).
2) Convert an angle in degrees to the radian measure using the math library.
3) Find the distance between 2 points on the Earth given their coordinates using the Haversine formula.
4) Students in 3 classes (each with a certain number of students) must be grouped into groups as follows: class 1- 5 groups, class 2- 7 groups, class 3- 6 groups. All the remaining students form the last group. Find the individual group sizes.

Set 4
1) Find the roots of a quadratic equation.
2) Check whether a date entered by a user is valid (accounting for leap years).

Set 5
1) Check whether a number is an Angstrom number.
2) Check whether a number is a perfect number.
3) Check whether a given string is a palindrome.

Set 6
1) Use recursion to find the smallest element in a list.
2) Use recursion to find a^b.
3) Use recursion to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

Set 7
1) Write a function to mimic the filter() function. Use it to remove every string that begins with a digit in a list of strings.
2) Write a function to mimic the reduce() function. Use it to find the largest integer in a set of integers and their sum.
